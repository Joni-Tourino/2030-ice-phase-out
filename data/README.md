# Data files

Here you can access the data files or links to charts/maps (made either with Datawrapper or Flourish) for the stories I've written in the website. Below, you can read what datasets I used and where you can access the data I used to create my charts and maps.

# <a href="https://joni-tourino.github.io/2030-ice-phase-out/25000-public-charge-points-more-to-come.html" target="_blank">25,000 EV charging points in the UK</a>

For this story I used a <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IwELW/" target="_blank">table</a> where you can search any local authority in the UK with information about their EV chargers, EVs licensed and the rate of chargers per 1,000 vehicles licensed.
I also created three different maps that shows the evolution of the rate of EV charging points per 1,000 EVs licensed for <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lWlZQ/" target="_blank">July 2021</a>, <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/U4Ma6/" target="_blank">July 2020</a> and <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pGox9/" target="_blank">October 2019</a> (the Department for Transport only collects data from EV chargepoints since that time).

The datasets used for those charts come from the Department for Transport. The first one is a list of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/electric-vehicle-charging-device-statistics-july-2021" target="_blank">charging points</a> in the UK which uses the data provided from Zap-Map. While the second one is the number of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/all-vehicles-veh01" target="_blank">electric vehicles licensed</a>. I used the dataset VEH0131 because the table only listed vehicles identified as "battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or range-extended electric", but unfortunately this dataset does <b>not</b> separate private owned with company owned ones. Thus I still needed to use the dataset VEH0132 to understand which areas had a high level of ultra-low emission vehicles (which includes other types of vehicles along electric ones) licensed by companies.

# <a href="https://joni-tourino.github.io/2030-ice-phase-out/Coventry-leads-ev-chargers-outside-london.html" target="_blank">Coventry leads EV charger devices outside London</a>

For that article I created a <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OAiq2/" target="_blank">ranking table</a> with only the local authorities with the highest number of public EV chargers instead of reusing the entire table from the 25,000 UK charging points one. There was no need to have the full list, since the story is about why and how Coventry managed to be the area with the highest number outside London.

Since most of the chargers that have been installed in Coventry came from a Government grant I also made a <a href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7078676/" target="_blank">chart</a> showing which regions in the UK installed the most through that scheme (ORCS). The data for this chart comes from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-statistics" target="_blank">Department for Transport</a> which includes numbers for different EV Government grants (home chargers, public chargers and working chargers).

# <a href="https://joni-tourino.github.io/2030-ice-phase-out/Nissan-joins-Race-to-Zero-campaign.html" target="_blank">Nissan joins Race to Zero's UN campaign</a>

Here I made a <a href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/6736713/" target="_blank">Flourish card template</a> of the top 10 automakers in the UK from last year to show how each is working to the phase out of fossil fuel, when they aim to achieve carbon neutrality and if they are planning on building gigafactories in the UK or in Europe.

In order to create this cards template, I searched for the data in the Sustainability Reports from those companies (or their parent companies in some cases), which is published in their respective websites. But I also looked at press releases when the information was too vague or inexistent in the report.
