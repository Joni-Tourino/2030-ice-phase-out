# Data files

Here you can access the data files or links to charts/maps (made either with Datawrapper or Flourish) for the stories I've written in the website.

# 25,000 EV charging points in the UK

For this story I used a <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IwELW/" target="_blank">table</a> where you can search any local authority in the UK with information about their EV chargers, EVs licensed and the rate of chargers per 1,000 vehicles licensed.
I also created three different maps that shows the evolution of the rate of EV charging points per 1,000 EVs licensed for <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lWlZQ/" target="_blank">July 2021</a>, <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/U4Ma6/" target="_blank">July 2020 and <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pGox9/" target="_blank">October 2019</a> (the Department for Transport only collects data from EV chargepoints since that time).

# Coventry leads EV charger devices outside London

For that article I created a <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OAiq2/1/" target="_blank">ranking table</a> with only the local authorities with the highest number of public EV chargers insteaf of reusing the table from the 25,000 UK charging points one. This way you can directly see which areas are doing best in the UK.

Since most of the chargers that have been installed in Coventry came from a Government grant I also made a <a href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7078676/" target="_blank">chart</a> showing which regions in the UK installed the most through that scheme (ORCS).

# Nissan joins Race to Zero's UN campaign

Here I made a <a href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/6736713/" target="_blank">Flourish card template</a> of the top 10 automakers in the UK from last year to show how each is working to the phase out of fossil fuel, when they aim to achieve carbon neutrality and if they are planning on building gigafactories in the UK or in Europe.
