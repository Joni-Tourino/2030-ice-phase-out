	<!-- Interview -->

    <div class="content">

        <p>Despite the need to phase out of fossil fuel cars by 2030, there are still misconceptions about electric vehicles (EV). Recently, Allegra Stratton (spokesperson for the COP26) and Michael Fabricant, Lichfield's MP, have declared to prefer their diesel vehicle, arguing "rage-anxiety" didn't make switching to an EV attractive enough. A feeling that Gill Nowell, one of the co-founders of <abbr title="Electric Vehicle Association">EVA</abbr> England, does not share:</p>
        <blockquote>"I think it's helpful to go back to basics, and to remember that in the UK, 99% of all car journeys are under 100 miles. The daily average mileage is about 28 miles."</blockquote>
        <p>For Gill, the sheer fact of driving an EV or being driven in a electric car can help people understand that "range-anxiety" is not actually an issue. She said:</p>
        <p>This does not mean she never experienced it, but it is not something she faces often:</p>
        <blockquote>"I never run my electric car down to near empty. It's just something that I never do. I did it once, and I won't do it again. so you know whilst I think range anxiety is valid, and can be valid for some people you know I've experienced range anxiety on what was supposed to be an eight mile round trip, and it turned into a 10 hour round trip and quite a lot of stress, because some of the chargers at the motorway service areas weren't working. So it did get stressful so I've really been there and I've really experienced range anxiety, but that was almost, I think 9 months ago."</blockquote>
        <p>Motor service were one of the common issues EVA England received from members in the past, an issue that has since been solved with the change of owner from one of the motorway services.</p>
        <p>EVA England opened its door to members in March 2021, with already a few hundred. Even people who still don't own an electric car can join and might find the information they are looking for.</p>
        <blockquote>"We provide all members with a really useful sort of information pack. It's really designed to take everybody through and help them on their electric car journey, no matter what stage they're at actually. And a lot of the challenges I think are relatively straightforward to address, so things like you know terminology."</blockquote>
        <p>Terminology such as CHAdeMO or CCS, which are the two most used standards for charging electric vehicles</p>
        

        <p>Despite being able to charge at home, she knows that not everyone can do so and the price of on-street charging differs between the two.</p>
        <blockquote>"I think what needs to happen, looking forward, is there needs to be a way in which to make that cost more favourable to the EV driver. And really not to discriminate between those who can charge at home, and those who can't charge at home."</blockquote>
        <p>She added that the possibility to decide on charging her car at home when it’s the cheapest and greenest, is being implemented to on-street charging and that could reduce prices:</p>
        <blockquote>"<b>Connected Kerb</b> are looking at the same approach for on-street charging. You can actually schedule your use of an on-street charger, that it will only, the car will only charge when it's cheapest and greenest to do so, which is really, really interesting. I think it would be fantastic for us to get to a place where the cost is fair, because I can charge really really cheaply at home."</blockquote>
        <p>For Gill, charging at home cost her between one and three pence per mile. And does almost 99% of her charging at home.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And with air pollution causing <a href="https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/news/reducing-air-pollution-uk-progress-report-2018" target="_blank"><b>40,000 deaths</b></a> per year in the UK, making sure that the air we breathe is clean is essential. And Gill thinks that electric vehicles are part of the solution:</p>
        <p>"You know of course we need to walk more, we need to cycle more, we need to use sustainable and green public transport more. But if we do need to use a car to get from A to B. Then, let's make sure it's got a plug".</p>
