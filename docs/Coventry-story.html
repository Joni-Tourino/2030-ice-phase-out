        <p>Coventry installed more than <b>400</b> public charging points in the past four years, since the launch of the On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (ORCS), more than double the numbers of <b>Brighton and Hove</b>, the second local authority with the highest number.</p>
        <p>The release of the latest data from the Department of Transport goes along the one released earlier in the month with Coventry as the local authority outside London with the highest number of public charging points installed, 456.</p>

        <p>“With another 100, I think, due to be installed by the end of the year” said Coventry Councillor Jim O’Boyle. Asked about what was the strategy and reason for Coventry to install more than 400 public charging points, the Councillor said “The transition from an internal combustion engine, particularly from petrol and diesel was heading in the direction of electric and it makes sense to steal a march on that particular process because Coventry was the birthplace of the British motor industry” adding “It's always been in our DNA.”</p>
        <p>It’s also in the Councillor’s DNA, as he worked in the automotive industry, and is aware that for those who cannot install a charger at home, the alternative is to charge it on the road, “If you haven't got a charge point, you've got no way of charging a car. Why would you buy an electric vehicle, so you know it's the old chicken and egg which comes first. So that's the general thinking behind it.”</p>
        <p>He also mentioned how it would also help improve air quality in the city, which decided against implementing a Clean Air Zone, “We can improve our air quality quicker than actually having a clean air zone”, adding “What we're trying to do is achieve twofold. One is actually improve the air quality, at the same time encourage takeoff on potential electric vehicle. So for example, we have one particularly bad spot in the city that has been identified as in need of pretty urgent work in order to improve the air quality. And that particular area we put in 30 fast charge points, which we installed just at the end of 2019.”</p>
        <p>Making sure the city installs as many public charging points is part of a long term process for the Councillor. Even if switching to an electric vehicle can still be seen as expensive, the Councillor said "It's about changing perception and behaviour. And you know it'll take time, but it's the right thing to do, because the alternative is to do nothing.”</p>

        <p>Part of that long term process, is also the proposal to have a gigafactory on the site of the Coventry Airport, to attract the automotive industry in the UK, “If you don't build the factories here, you will lose those automotive companies to other countries because they need to build they need to manufacture the factories close to where they're building the vehicles, and if we don't get our act together and start building mass gigafactories like the one proposed at Coventry airport, then I'm afraid, these multinational companies who have got interest in countries all over the world will say, well, we'll go somewhere else, and they will, and the government have been told that time and time again, and it's really important to get that message across.”</p>
        <p>During the interview it was also mentioned the electrification of the bus fleet, “We're going to be the first city in the country to electrify all of our bus fleet.” But not just that, the Councillor also mentioned different projects taking place in Coventry such as trams, or battery storage and the building of the electric black cab. With the city trying to become a hub of electric transport:</p>
        <blockquote>“I mean there's loads of things we do it's not one particular aspect it's many different aspects of travel, and that the reason why I focus on this quite a lot, is that there's been a lot of work in terms of reducing the carbon footprint in all aspects of our economy.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“The one thing that has remained stubbornly difficult to move across has been transport over the last 30 years. And they're really start to get on top of that now. And I think that we're starting to really make great strides.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Coventry has got a lot of expertise, a lot of companies who have some fantastic ideas and skills, and we need to utilise that to come forward and sort of be examples of how this new technology can be turned into the real world and actually make a difference for people and give them choices that at the moment we don't have.”</blockquote>

        <p>And as Coventry is the UK City of Culture in 2021, how are they making sure to connect both the automotive world with the culture in order to showcase how the city is building its future around electric vehicles?</p>
        <p>The Councillor said that he was headed to the Coventry Transport Museum right after the interview and said “Down there at the moment is an exhibition, specifically identified on future mobility, transportation. And it's an exhibition open to the public. And you can see some of the amazing concepts and actual real projects that have been involved and developed in Coventry at the moment.”</p>
