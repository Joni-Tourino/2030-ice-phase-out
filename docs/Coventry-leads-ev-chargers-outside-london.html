        <p>Coventry has installed more than <b>400</b> public electric vehicle (EV) charging points in the past four years, since the launch of a Government fund for local authorities (<abbr title="On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme">ORCS</abbr>).</p>
        <p>Doubling the numbers of <b>Brighton and Hove</b>, the second local authority with the highest number according to the latest data for the grant.</p>
        <p>"We've got 401 charge points in the city at the moment", said Coventry Councillor Jim O'Boyle, "With another 100, I think, due to be installed by the end of the year."</p>
        <p>The latest data from the Department for Transport has Coventry with <b>456</b> EV chargers and more than 1,000 electric cars licensed.</p>
        <iframe title="Coventry is the local authority with the highest number of public charging points outside of London" aria-label="table" id="datawrapper-chart-OAiq2" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OAiq2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="633"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
        </script>
        <p>“The transition from an internal combustion engine was heading in the direction of electric and it makes sense to steal a march on that particular process because Coventry was the birthplace of the British motor industry”, adding “It's always been in our DNA.”</p>
        <p>“If you haven't got a charge point, you've got no way of charging a car. Why would you buy an electric vehicle? It's the old chicken and egg, which comes first. That's the general thinking behind it.”</p>
        <p>He also mentioned how it would also help improve air quality in the city, which decided against implementing a clean air zone. “We can improve our air quality quicker than actually having a clean air zone”, adding:</p>
        <blockquote>“What we're trying to do is achieve twofold. One is actually improving the air quality, and at the same time encourage takeoff on potential electric vehicle.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>"For example, we have one particularly bad spot in the city that has been identified as in need of pretty urgent work to improve the air quality. In that particular area we put in 30 fast charge points at the end of 2019.”</blockquote>
        <p>Making sure the city installs as many public charging points is part of a long-term process for the Councillor.</p>
        <p>Even if switching to an electric vehicle can still be seen as expensive, the Councillor said "It's about changing perception and behaviour. It'll take time, but it's the right thing to do. Because the alternative is to do nothing.”</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7078676"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> 
        <p>Part of that long term process, is also the proposal to have a gigafactory on the site of the Coventry Airport, to attract the automotive industry in the UK.</p>
        <blockquote>“If you don't build the factories here, you will lose those automotive companies to other countries. They need to build the factories close to where they're building the vehicles.”</blockquote>
        <p>Coventry also wants to lead on the electrification of their bus fleet, “We're going to be the first city in the country to electrify all of our bus fleet.”</p>
        <p>But not just that, the Councillor also mentioned different projects taking place in Coventry such as trams, battery storage or the fact the electric black cab is built in Coventry. With the city trying to become a hub for electric transport:</p>
        <blockquote>“I mean there's loads of things we do it's not one particular aspect it's many different aspects of travel, and the reason why I focus on this quite a lot, is that there's been a lot of work in terms of reducing the carbon footprint in all aspects of our economy.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“The one thing that has remained stubbornly difficult to move across has been transport over the last 30 years. And I think that we're starting to really make great strides.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“Coventry has got a lot of expertise, a lot of companies who have some fantastic ideas and skills. We need to utilise that to come forward, be examples of how this new technology can be turned into the real world. And actually make a difference for people, and give them choices that at the moment we don't have.”</blockquote>
