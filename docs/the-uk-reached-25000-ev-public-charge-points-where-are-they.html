        <div class="content">
          <p>Last month the Secretary of State for Transport, Grant Shapps, announced that the UK had reached 25,000 on-street electric vehicle (EV) charging points.</p>
          <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve hit a major milestone, with 25,000 public EV chargepoints now available across the UK🔌🚗<br> <br>I’m pleased to announce the appointment of <a href="https://twitter.com/RCA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RCA</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/PA_Consulting?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PA_Consulting</a> to design an iconic EV chargepoint that could become as recognisable as the red post box, London bus, or black cab👇 <a href="https://t.co/jAWHojvmuf">pic.twitter.com/jAWHojvmuf</a></p>&mdash; Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP (@grantshapps) <a href="https://twitter.com/grantshapps/status/1424752899599515649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
          <p>Despite that annoucement, arguments against switching to an EV stating <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ill-stick-with-diesel-says-no-10-climate-spokeswoman-nhg8kzhmm" target="_blank">range-anxiety</a> or lack of charging points still persist.</p>
          <p>"I think there's a lot of work to be done in just raising awareness of that kind of information," said <b>Gill Nowell</b>, a board member from <b>EVA England</b> (an association for EV drivers in England).</p>
          <p>The average mileage per day in 2019 was 20 miles and Gill added: "In the UK, 99% of all car journeys are under 100 miles."</p>
          <p>For the long-distance journeys, she explained those just needed a little bit more planning.</p>
         <div style="background-color:lightgray;" class="border-charger"> 
          <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-vision-for-the-rapid-chargepoint-network-in-england/government-vision-for-the-rapid-chargepoint-network-in-england" target="_blank">Government</a> aims to have at least <b>six ultra-rapid</b> (charging capacity of 100<abbr title="Killowat is a unit of power">kW</abbr> or more) chargers at motorway service areas in England by 2023.</p>
          <p>Currently, there are more than 1,100 ultra-rapid chargers according to <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/statistics/" target="_blank">Zap-Map</a>.</p>
          <p>Those chargers are able to fully charge a battery in less than 30 minutes, in half that time most could charge more than 100 miles.</p>
          <p>More than half of the public chargers currently installed are known as <b>fast</b> chargers (the power ranges from 7 to 22 kW).</p>
          <p>One hour of charging with those type of chargers will add between <a href="https://pod-point.com/guides/driver/how-long-to-charge-an-electric-car">30 to 90 miles</a> to the battery.</p>
        </div>
          <p>Something as simple as having people test-drive an electric car can do the trick. "I do think once more people start driving electric cars," added Gill, "I'm not sure that whole charging points issue is going to be as much of an issue."</p>

        <h3>Where are they located?</h3>

          <p><b>Westminster</b> is leading the count with 1,059 charging devices, followed by Wandsworth with 603. While, Hammersmith and Fulham with 554, finishes the podium. All three are London boroughs.</p>
          <p>From the ten local authorities with the highest number of chargers, only three (Coventry, Milton Keynes and Brighton and Hove) are located outside of London.</p>
          <p>Ten local authorities have less than ten charging devices, only the <b>Isles of Scilly</b> still has none.</p>
          <p>The majority still have less than 100 public EV charging devices, only <b>three in every twenty</b> (57) already with more than 100.</p>
          <p>In October 2019, the earliest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/electric-vehicle-charging-device-statistics-july-2021/electric-vehicle-charging-device-statistics-july-2021" target="_blank">data source</a> available, less than a third (103) of local authorities had fewer than 10 charging points. With just 33 who had already installed more than 100.</p>
          <p>Barrow-in-Furness had none, alongside the Isles of Scilly, and is now at eight.</p>

          </script>
          <p>Wales has the highest rate of charging devices per 1,000 licensed EVs with 101. Scotland is second with 87, followed by Northern Ireland with 60 and England with 49.</p>
          <p>Overall, the rate for the United Kingdom is 53 charging devices per 1,000 cars licensed.</p>
       
        <h3>EVs licensed includes the ones registered by companies</h3>

          <p><b>Pembrokeshire</b> has the highest rate with almost <b>two vehicles</b> per public charging device.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, <b>Stockport</b> has the lowest (Isles of Scilly excluded, since it lacks a single EV public charger) at one per 1,000 vehicles.</p>
          <p>This is explained by the fact that the dataset from the <b>Department for Transport</b> does not separate private owned and company owned electric vehicles.</p>
          <p>Stockport being home to one of the largest <a href="https://www.field-dynamics.co.uk/so-where-exactly-are-all-the-evs/" target="_blank">lease processing centres</a> in the UK, puts it at the top of local authorities with the most EVs licensed with almost 35,000.</p>
          <p>A different dataset, that includes other types of vehicles than EVs, shows that this is also the case for most of the top 10 of local authorities with the highest number of licensed electric vehicles.</p>
          <p>Slough, Milton Keynes, Swindon, Leeds or Peterborough all have more than 10,000 ULEVs licensed by companies.</p>

          <p>Not every driver will have to rely on those chargers, has most will be able to charge at home.</p>
          <p>Field Dynamics <a href="https://www.field-dynamics.co.uk/research/public-charger-catchment-research/" target="_blank">estimated</a> that 7.8 million households (slightly more than one in three) outside of London do not have access to off-street parking and will rely on public spaces to charge their vehicles.</p>

          <p>Some projects about public charging are looking to increase the installation of chargers as well as giving a nearby option for those who cannot charge off-street.</p>
         </div>
        <div class="content"><h2>Charge points that do not take space in the street</h2>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.trojanenergyltd.com/media-room/first-of-a-kind-trojan-energy-chargepoints-go-live-in-brent" target="_blank"><abbr title="Subsurface Technology for Electric Pathways">STEP</abbr> Project</a>, funded by the Office for Zero Emission Vehicle (OZEV), aims to deliver charge points to households who cannot charge at home, which approximately represents <b>40% households in the UK</b>, while not taking any space in the street.</p>
          <p>The first five charge points were launched at the end of July in <b>Brent</b>, a borough in London, with 145 charge points being installed later in the year across Brent and Camden.</p>
          <p>“One of the key criteria really of the funding," said Sarah Clements, the Project Manager from Element Energy, "Was that the charge points really shouldn't take away space from the street."</p>
          <p>The charging point for the project Sarah leads is comprised of two parts designed by <b>Trojan Energy</b>. The first part is the charge point that is flat and flush with the ground. “That has a really robust sealing mechanism, preventing risk of water damage” she said.</p>
          <p>The other part is called a <b>lance</b>, and is what connects the charge point with the car.</p>
          <blockquote>“It's really easy to start charging. You plug it in both ends, and they just lock your car and it starts charging."</blockquote>
          <p>Sarah added:</p>
          <blockquote>"You don't need to worry with any additional cards or anything to pay for the charge point. Your lance essentially is your unique identifier. All of the billing happens automatically because you have your own lance.”</blockquote>
          <p>A lance that is provided for free during the trial period, with a retail price of £400 afterwards.</p>

        <h3>The advantage of installing multiple charge points at once</h3>

          <p>One of the advantages of this project is that one charge point can be installed in the same street.</p>
          <blockquote>"The way the system works, 15 charge points are installed in a row and are associated with one grid connection."</blockquote>
          <blockquote>"The grid connection is in a cabinet on the street and the idea is that there's no dedicated bays. Which means that you don't have as much tension with petrol or diesel drivers on the streets."</blockquote>
          <p>Even if you don’t find a parking spot in front of your home, you can still park nearby and charge your vehicle without any problem by connecting the lance to a charge point that is available.</p>
          <p>If 15 charge points installed at once seems that it would need a high grid connection, Sarah noted that “We've designed the system to meet the requirements of a grid connection on-street. The maximum power is 68 kilowatts, and then splitting this power across the 15 charge points.”</p>
          <p>Even if all 15 charging points are connected at the same time, the energy used would never exceed those 68 kilowatts and would be split up between all of them.</p>
          <p>Trojan Energy are already looking at solutions that could allow the user to program when they want to charge. “The idea would be that we can give the customer the choice as to whether they want to have like a fully flexible system.</p>
          <p>"The idea would be that if they plug in at, for example 4pm, we wouldn't charge them until later at night (off peak hours) if they've opted into that flexible option.”</p>
          <p>Sarah added that 90 of the charge points in Brent will soon have a smart charging system giving the option to drivers to decide when to charge, and avoid peak hours.</p>
          <br>

        <h3>The feedback so far has been positive</h3>

          <p>The trial has recruited three different groups of participants to receive feedback from: EV drivers, prospective EV drivers and observers.</p>
          <p>Each type of participant will help inform what aspects could be implemented with the lance or its design, and to understand the behaviour of neighbours.</p>
          <p>They are interested in receiving feedback from people with mobility disabilities and also the parking behaviour of non-EV drivers.</p>

            <figcaption class="caption">The lance that connects the car with the charge point | Credit: <a href="https://dcoolimages.com/" target="_blank">Darren Cool</a></figcaption>
          <p>Sarah explained that one aspect they are interested in knowing is if the Trojan project has encouraged people to buy an electric vehicle and so far the numbers are promising.</p>
          <blockquote>“Out of the people we surveyed who are prospective EV drivers, over half of them, about 51%, said ‘you know the Trojan trial being nearby has been a decisive factor in me thinking about getting an EV’.”</blockquote></p>
          <p>She added that four trial participants have made the change to an electric vehicle already and six more are keen to do so in the near future.</p>
          <p>Even though the trial is based in two London boroughs, Sarah doesn’t see why the charge points from the STEP project couldn’t be exported in other cities in the UK or even abroad.</p>
          <blockquote>“There's no reason why it couldn't be installed in any city in the UK or Europe or worldwide.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>"The key criteria is having a high density of houses without driveways. It's really for these high density areas where you don't have people with driveways or garages.”</blockquote>
          <p>For Sarah, the novel aspect that could help faster increase the installation of public charge points is the possibility to have whole streets installed at once, “I think the key part really is that, for the first time we're able to install a set of charge points for a whole street, which is the novel aspect of this technology.”</p>
