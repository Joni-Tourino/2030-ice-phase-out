        <p><b>Nissan</b> announced they joined the <a href="https://unfccc.int/climate-action/race-to-zero-campaign" target="_blank">Race to Zero</a> campaign, supported by the UN. This makes them the first Japanese vehicle manufacturer to do so.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúTo accelerate global efforts to achieve carbon neutrality, Nissan will continue to address various issues in a responsible manner, including further promotion of electrification. Also at Nissan we are determined to fulfil our role as a company that will continue to be needed by our stakeholders in the future.‚Äù said Nissan‚Äôs CEO <b>Makoto Uchida</b> in a <a href="https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/nissan-brings-its-innovation-and-excitement-to-the-race-to-zero" target="_blank">press release</a> from the company.</p>
        <p>The company also signed the Business Ambition Pledge for 1.5¬∞C, committing to keep global temperatures rise to 1.5¬∞C.</p>
        <p>The annoucement was welcomed on Twitter by Kwasi Kwarteng, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A welcome commitment from <a href="https://twitter.com/Nissan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Nissan</a> - a perfect example of a company innovating + developing new tech to cut emissions<br><br>Together with <a href="https://twitter.com/envisioncn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Envisioncn</a>, their <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sunderland?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Sunderland</a> plant will benefit from a major ¬£1 billion investment to build the UK‚Äôs first Gigafactory üöò üá¨üáß <a href="https://t.co/wwOHxYRUiF">https://t.co/wwOHxYRUiF</a></p>&mdash; Kwasi Kwarteng (@KwasiKwarteng) <a href="https://twitter.com/KwasiKwarteng/status/1430900610589593602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
        <p>Earlier in the year, the Japanese automaker pledged to be carbon neutral by 2050 and have all their newest vehicles to be electrified by the early 2030s in Europe, the United States, Japan and China.</p>
        <p>As well as a <b>¬£1bn</b> investment in the UK for an EV Hub at their <b>Sunderland</b> site, with the intent to build a gigafactory there.</p>
            
        <h2>No clear path to a complete phase out from BMW and KIA</h2>
            
        <p>Fossil fuel cars have their days counted in Europe. The UK set the clock to 2030 for the ban. In 2035 it will be the turn for hybrid vehicles, while the EU will ban fossil fuel cars.</p>
        <p>How's the automotive companies preparing for that? Of the top ten brands sold in the UK, half have a date similar or sooner than 2030.</p>
        <p>The only one with a worldwide goal is Mercedes-Benz, who aims to achieve a complete phase out by the end of the decade.</p>
        <p>Of the other five, only <b>BMW</b> and <b>Kia</b> haven‚Äôt declared a phase out date, either worldwide or for Europe.</p>
        <p>Alongside <b>Toyota</b>, they have yet to announce the construction of a gigafactory in Europe or the UK.</p>
        <p>Toyota is currently betting a lot in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/climate/toyota-electric-hydrogen.html" target="_blank">hydrogen</a> cars, despite the early success of the Toyota Prius, an hybrid model.</p>

        <h3>Gigafactories in the UK</h3>

        <p>So far, most of the gigafactories announced in the UK do not come from the top 10 automakers, except for Nissan.</p>
        <p>Their plant in Sunderland will have an initial capacity of <b>9GWh</b> and production of <b>100,000</b> electric batteries per year.</p>
        <p><b>Vauxhall</b>, the only British brand in the standings, is subject to its parent company‚Äôs decision. Stellantis' plans on building five across Europe, with France, Germany and Italy as three of the places decided.</p>
        <p>Two other gigafactory projects have been in talks, one in Blyth by <b>BritishVolt</b> and another one at Coventry Airport <a href="https://www.coventry.gov.uk/news/article/3918/plans_submitted_for_west_midlands_gigafactory" target="_blank">proposed</a> by Coventry City Council and Warwick District Council.</p>
